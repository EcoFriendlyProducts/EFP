				<p>
					1.	Eco-friendly products are products that are designed to have minimal negative impact on the environment.

They aim to reduce waste and pollution, conserve resources, and minimize carbon emissions.
						<br/> <br/>
					2.	Eco-friendly products can include a wide range of items, such as clothing made from organic cotton, household cleaners that use natural ingredients, biodegradable packaging materials, and energy-efficient appliances. Many companies are now focusing on creating eco-friendly products in response to the growing consumer demand for environmentally sustainable alternatives.
						<br/> <br/>
					3.	Using eco-friendly products can help reduce your carbon footprint and contribute to a healthier environment. By choosing products that are sustainable and responsibly manufactured, you can make a positive impact on the world around you.
						<br/> <br/>

						<br/> <br/>
					5. These products are designed to reduce waste, conserve resources, and decrease pollution.
						<br/> <br/>

						<br/> <br/>
					7. They can include a wide range of products, from household cleaning supplies to clothing and personal care items.
						<br/> <br/>
					8. Using eco-friendly products can help individuals and businesses reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a healthier planet.
						<br/> <br/>
					9. Many eco-friendly products are certified by third-party organizations, such as the Forest Stewardship Council or the Global Organic Textile Standard, to ensure their environmental sustainability.
						<br/> <br/>
					10. Some governments offer incentives, such as tax breaks or grants, for businesses that switch to eco-friendly practices or products.
						<br/> <br/>

						<br/> <br/>
					12. Choosing eco-friendly products can be an easy way to make a positive impact on the environment and promote sustainable living.

					<h5 class="text-center fw-bold" style="color: sienna; text-decoration: underline;">Benifits Of Eco-Friendly Products</h5>
				<div class="col-lg-12 text-start" style="color: lightslategray;">
						<br/>
					<li> 
						<b>Save natural resources - </b> In your processes or in manufacturing a product, you can save resources by choosing for example: products that use less energy and less quantities of raw materials, renewable energy services, and products and services that use recycled materials or materials that would otherwise be waste 
					</li>
						<br/>
					<li>
						<b>Reduce your carbon emissions</b>, for example by using renewable energy or buying energy-efficient products to reduce your energy use.
					</li>
						<br/>
					<li>
						<b>Reduce the amount of waste </b> sent to landfill, for example by buying products that last longer, and that can be reused and recycled.
					</li>
						<br/>
					<li>
						<b>Help your local or wider communities - </b> For example by buying local you are creating work for local producers and suppliers; and by buying fairly traded goods you are helping to improve living and working conditions for the producers' communities.
					</li>
						<br/>
					<li>
						Create a market for new sustainable goods and materials to help the green economy grow and create new green jobs.
					</li>

					<h5 class="text-center fw-bold" style="color: sienna; text-decoration: underline;">Why Should We Use Eco-Friendly Products</h5>
				<div class="col-lg-12 text-start" style="color: lightslategray;">
						<br/>
					<li>
						<b>You Help Save Nature: </b> Over-exploitation, pollution, and destruction of natural resources can cause an imbalance in nature. Since mankind is a part of nature, it is crucial to switch to eco-friendly products to help save nature from destruction.
					</li>
						<br/>
					<li>
						<b> Save Mankind: </b> Everything in this world is interdependent. If any part of nature is affected, humans too will be affected by it- directly or indirectly. We see how many new diseases are creeping into society every day- all this has roots lying in the irresponsible production and disposal of products.
					</li>
						<br/>
					<li>
						<b> A Healthier Life: </b> All-natural products are devoid of chemicals that adversely affect human health. If you switch to eco-friendly products, you are helping nature from a broader perspective and choosing to live a healthier, safer, non-toxic, chemical-free life for yourself.
					</li>
						<br/>
					<li>
						<b> Cost-Effective: </b>Eco-friendly products often run on non-exhaustive resources of the environment. This means that they are more cost-effective than any other artificially made product available.
					</li>

					</li>
						<br/>
					<li>
						<b>Conserving resources: </b> Eco-friendly products are designed to reduce waste and conserve resources, such as water and energy, which can help mitigate the impact of global warming.
